## Summary
Tram-One is a view framework for developers who want to jump straight into
building on the web. At its core, Tram-One is a collection of a few packages
that gives you the tools to start working right away. That is to say...
Batteries Included!

### Why?
Tram-One is a project built to make exposing custom elements easy, and to
have redux-like state management, and basic routing by default. It was created
out of  the frustration of having to scaffold the same dependencies over and
over again.

Tram-One was also created to avoid a lot of the syntax that locks you into
frameworks like Vue and React. The components written here can mimic the syntax
you're already familiar, or help you create pure HTML friendly code.

## This Repo and the Tram-One Org
This repo contains the main Tram-One framework, which can be installed and
used to make web-apps. The Tram-One org (found at https://github.com/Tram-One)
includes many of the dependencies as well as the websites for the project. The
dependencies, while made for Tram-One, can be used in other projects.
