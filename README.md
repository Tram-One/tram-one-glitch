## Developement Commands

- `npm start` - starts a server hosting the webapp on localhost using
[webpack-serve](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-serve)
and will watch for changes
- `npm run build` - builds a final distributable using
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- `npm test` - runs tests in
[jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html)
